        Versatile professional with a strong background in technical maintenance, logistics, and field operations, built
        through hands-on experience in industrial and public service environments. I am used to working in demanding
        contexts where reliability, safety, and efficiency are critical.
      </p>

      <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
        Alongside my technical and operational roles, I developed solid management and entrepreneurial skills through
        multiple business projects, including team coordination, process organization, and decision-making under
        pressure. I also built strong digital competencies, allowing me to combine operational thinking with structured,
        efficient execution.
